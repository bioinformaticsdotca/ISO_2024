### Please Note
There will be an Amazon Web Services/Unix review session held on July 8 from 10AM-3PM EST. It will be held on Zoom, included in your registration fee, and is optional but highly recommended. The first module (10:10 - 11:10AM) will teach you how to connect to AWS so you can complete the workshop labs. We recommend all students attend this portion. The remaining sections will teach the basics of Unix and using the command line; we recommend that participants who do not have experience with the command line attend this portion.
